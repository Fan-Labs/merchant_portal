        <li>These Terms and Conditions survives the acceptance of Purchaser’s Token purchase application.</li>
        <h2><b>Assignment</b></h2>
        <li>Purchaser shall not assign these Terms and Conditions, or any contractual rights represented by the Tokens, without the prior written consent of Token Generator. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section will be void. Token Generator may assign these Terms and Conditions to an affiliated entity at any time without Purchaser's prior consent. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms and Conditions, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, all rights, obligations, and limitations arising under Tokens as per the terms hereof shall remain with Tokens, regardless of ownership. Accordingly, such rights, obligations, and limitations will transfer as Tokens are transferred from one owner to another. Prior to a Purchaser selling Tokens after the Token Generator’s sale of Tokens is complete, such Purchaser shall ensure that the buyer of any such Tokens undertakes to comply with all the provisions of these Terms and Condition as if such buyer were a Purchaser in the Hyperion Fund Initial Coin Offering.
        </li>
        <p><b>Severance</b></p>
        <li>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable under any law of any jurisdiction for any reason, the provision shall be modified to make it valid and, to the extent possible, effectuate the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted.  Any modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision pursuant to this section shall not affect or impair the validity and enforceability of the rest of these Terms and Conditions, nor the validity and enforceability of such provision or part-provision under the law of any other jurisdiction.</li>
        <h2><b>Waivers</b></h2>
        <li>The failure by Token Generator to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions will not constitute a present or future waiver of such right or provision nor limit Token Generator's right to enforce such right or provision at a later time. All waivers by Token Generator must be unequivocal and in writing to be effective.</li>
        <h2><b>Electronic communications</b></h2>
        <li>Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that Token Generator provides pursuant to these Terms and Conditions or in connection with or related to Purchaser's purchase of Tokens, may be provided by Token Generator and Administrator in electronic form.</li>
        <p><b>Irrevocability</b></p>
        <li>Unless otherwise set out herein, these Terms and Conditions are irrevocable.</li>
        <p><b>Governing law</b></p>
        <li>These Terms and Conditions shall be governed in all respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws, to the extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily applicable by statute and would permit or require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. All disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with these Terms and Conditions, including disputes relating to its validity, breach, termination or nullity shall be finally settled under by a court in the Cayman Islands.</li>
        <h2><b>Force Majeure</b></h2>
        <li>The Token Sale and the performance of the Token Generator’s activities set out in White Paper development roadmap may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure events. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, a force majeure event shall mean any extraordinary event or circumstances which could not be prevented by Token Generator and shall include: hardware, software or other utility failures, changes in market forces or technology, software or smart contract bugs, changes in blockchain-related protocols, acts of nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal, state or federal governmental agencies or other circumstances beyond Token Generator's control, which were not in existence at the time of Token Sale. Purchaser understands and agrees that Token Generator shall not be liable and disclaims all liability to Purchaser in connection with an force majeure event. </li>
        <h2><b>English</b></h2>
        <li>Only English versions of the White Paper, the Terms and Conditions and Token Generator's communications shall be considered official. The English version shall prevail in case of differences in translation.</li>
        <p><b>Execution</b></p>
        <p>By checking the “I Agree” button on the Portal, Purchaser agrees to comply with and be bound by these Terms and Conditions. Purchaser acknowledges and accepts that all purchases of rights to Tokens from the Token Generator are final, and there are no refunds or cancellations, except as expressly provided for in these Terms and Conditions or as may be required by applicable law or regulation. Purchaser further acknowledges and accepts that the Token Generator reserves the right to refuse or cancel these Terms and Conditions at any time in its sole discretion.</p>

        <p><b>Schedule 1</b></p>
        <p>Who are Eligible Purchasers?</p>
        <p>From time to time, Token Generator may amend the criteria for determining who is an Eligible Purchaser for the purpose of a purchase of Tokens.</p>
        <p>Initially, all Purchasers are <b>Eligible Purchasers</b> except the following:</p>
        <li> a Purchaser whose acquisition of Tokens would cause a breach of the law or requirements of any country or governmental authority, including anti-money laundering regulations or conventions;</li>
        <li> a Purchaser who is acting on behalf of terrorists or terrorist organisations, including those persons or entities that are included on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons maintained by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (<b>OFAC</b>) or on the sanctions lists adopted by the United Nations and the European Union to such extent such sanctions are extended by the UK Government to its Overseas Territories, as such lists may be amended from time to time;</li>
        <li> a Purchaser who acts, directly or indirectly, for a senior foreign political figure, any member of a senior foreign political figure's immediate family or any close associate of a senior foreign political figure unless Token Generator, after being specifically notified by Purchaser in writing that it is such a person, conducts further due diligence, and determines that the purchase of Tokens is permitted;</li>
        <li> a Purchaser or an entity acting as trustee, agent, representative or nominee for a Purchaser that is a foreign shell bank;</li>
        <li> a Purchaser who makes representations or warranties in these Terms and Conditions that are not true when given or have ceased to be true;a Purchaser whose circumstances are such that, in the opinion of Token Generator's directors, its continued ownership of Tokens would cause an undue risk of adverse tax or other consequences to Token Generator. Those circumstances include those that affect that Purchaser directly or indirectly, whether taken alone or in conjunction with another person or persons, connected or not, or any other circumstance that appears to the directors to be relevant;</li>
        <li> a Purchaser, or a Purchaser that is an entity acting as trustee, agent, representative or nominee for a person, who is a <b>United States person</b> (within the meaning of Regulation S of the United States Securities Act) or is otherwise a resident of a Restricted Territory. The Purchaser must notify Token Generator immediately if Purchaser becomes a United States person, a resident of a Restricted Territory or becomes aware that any person for whom Purchaser holds shares as trustee, agent, representative or nominee has become a United States person or resident of a Restricted Territory. All persons who do come within any of these categories are known, collectively, as <b>Prohibited Persons</b>.</li>
        <p><b>Schedule 2</b></p>
        <p>Certain Risks and Disclosures</p>
        <p>PURCHASERS OF TOKENS SHOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A HIGH DEGREE OF VOLATILITY IN THE PRICE OF TOKENS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. A PURCHASE OF TOKENS INVOLVES A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE OF RISK. HOLDING A TOKEN IS NOT SIMILAR TO HOLDING A DEPOSIT WITH A BANK AND/OR MAKING AN INVESTMENT AND IS NOT INSURED OR GUARANTEED BY ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY. IN ASCERTAINING WHETHER A PURCHASE OF TOKENS IS SUITABLE FOR A PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER, SUCH PURCHASER SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, AMONGST OTHERS.</p>
        <h2><b>Risk factors specific to the investment objective and strategies</b></h2>
        <p>Risk of loss</p>
        <p>No guarantee or representation is made that Token Generator's investment program, including, without limitation, Token Generator's investment objective, diversification strategies or risk monitoring goals, will be successful. Investment results may vary substantially over time. </p>
        <p>No assurance can be made that profits will be achieved or that substantial or complete losses will not be incurred. </p>
        <p>Risk of total loss of capital</p>
        <p>While all investments risk the loss of capital, investments in cryptocurrencies should be considered substantially more speculative and significantly more likely to result in a total loss of capital than most other investment funds. Accordingly, an investment could result in the total loss of a Token purchaser's investment.</p>
        <p>Risk of total loss of capital</p>
        <p><i>Tok</i>en Generator may invest in Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs). SAFTs are not freely transferable. SAFT counterparties may refuse to comply with contractual obligations therein. SAFTs may not be compliant with relevant securities regulations.</p>
        <p><b>Risks relating to cryptocurrencies (including the Tokens)</b></p>
        <p><i>Cr</i><i>yptocurrencies generally</i></p>
        <p>The investment characteristics of cryptocurrencies, including the Tokens, differ from those of traditional currencies, commodities or securities. Investing and/or trading cryptocurrencies involves many risks and may not be suitable for all investors. Anyone looking to purchase Tokens and/or invest in cryptocurrencies through Token Generator should consult a fully qualified independent professional financial adviser. </p>
        <p>Developing regulatory regime</p>
        <p>The regulatory regime of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges is undeveloped, varies significantly among jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Some enterprises that Token Generator may invest in may operate in industries in which there are significant regulatory concerns. Token Generator believes that various legislative and executive bodies are currently considering, or may in the future consider, laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact Token Generator's ability to invest, or Token Generator's ability to gain market share. Failure by Token Generator to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines. It is possible that any jurisdiction may, in the near or distant future, adopt laws, regulations, policies or rules directly or indirectly affecting the Bitcoin network, generally, or restricting the right to acquire, own, hold, sell, convert, trade, or use cryptocurrencies, or to exchange cryptocurrencies for either fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. Developments in regulation may alter the nature of Token Generator's business or restrict the use of blockchain assets or the operation of a blockchain network upon which Token Generator relies in a manner that adversely affects Token Generator. Any additional regulatory obligations may cause Token Generator to incur extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, and/or ongoing compliance expense, possibly affecting the value of Tokens in an adverse manner. If Token Generator determines not to comply with such regulatory requirements, Token Generator may be liquidated at a time that is disadvantageous to a Token purchaser in Token Generator. To the extent Token Generator limits or reduces the scope of certain activities, investors' rights or investment initiatives, in order to limit the applicability of government regulation and supervision, may be adversely affected.</p>
        <p><i>Cr</i><i>yptocurrencies not guaranteed by central banks</i></p>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies that operate as a medium of exchange are not issued or guaranteed by any central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization, and there is no guarantee that such cryptocurrencies may operate as a legal medium of exchange in any jurisdiction. In fact, certain jurisdictions have completely prohibited the usage of certain cryptocurrencies in such jurisdiction. </p>
        <p>Third party usage</p>
        <p>As a relatively new product and technology, cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) are not yet widely adopted as a means of payment for goods and services. Banks and other established financial institutions may refuse to process funds for cryptocurrency transactions, process wire transfers to or from cryptocurrency exchanges, blockchain-related companies or service providers, or maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting in cryptocurrencies.</p>
        <p><b>Risks relating to Crypto asset exchanges</b></p>
        <p>Unregulated exchanges</p>
        <p>The exchanges on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and largely unregulated and may therefore be more exposed to theft, fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products. Exchanges generally require cash to be deposited in advance in order to purchase cryptocurrencies, and no assurance can be given that those deposit funds can be recovered. Additionally, upon the sale of cryptocurrencies, cash proceeds may not be received from the exchange for several business days. The participation in exchanges requires users to take on credit risk by transferring cryptocurrencies from a personal account to a third-party's account. Token Generator will take credit risk of an exchange every time it transacts. </p>
        <p>Transaction limits</p>
        <p>Crypto asset exchanges may impose daily, weekly, monthly or customer-specific transaction or distribution limits or suspend withdrawals entirely, rendering the exchange of virtual currency or digital token for fiat currency difficult or impossible. Additionally, cryptocurrencies prices and valuations on virtual exchanges have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors including the levels of liquidity on exchanges and operational interruptions and disruptions. The prices and valuation of cryptocurrencies remain subject to any volatility experienced by virtual exchanges, and any such volatility can adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator. </p>
        <p>Hacking risks</p>
        <p>Crypto asset exchanges are appealing targets for cybercrime, hackers and malware. It is possible that while engaging in transactions, any such exchange may cease operations due to theft, fraud, security breach, liquidity issues, or government investigation. In addition, banks may refuse to process wire transfers to or from exchanges. Over the past several years, many exchanges have, indeed, closed due to fraud, theft (e.g., Mt. Gox voluntarily shutting down because it was unable to account for over 850,000 Bitcoin), government or regulatory involvement, failure or security breaches (e.g., the voluntary temporary suspensions by Mt. Gox of cash withdrawals due to distributed denial of service attacks by malware and/or hackers), or banking issues.</p>
        <p>Lack of access</p>
        <p>Crypto asset exchanges may even shut down or go offline voluntarily, without any recourse to investors. Currently no specific regulatory protections exist in the Cayman Islands that would protect investors from financial losses if an exchange platform that exchanges or holds cryptocurrencies is hacked, fails or goes out of business. For example, on February 25, 2014, the Bitcoin website for one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, was taken offline suddenly, without any notice or warning to investors or the public. It was reported that Mt. Gox voluntarily shut down because it was unable to account for over 850,000 Bitcoin (valued at approximately 450 million dollars at the time). Although 200,000 Bitcoin have since been recovered, the reasons for their disappearance remain unclear. Mt. Gox ultimately filed for bankruptcy in Japan, and bankruptcy protection in Japan and the United States. As a result, the price of Bitcoin decreased drastically, adversely affecting all Bitcoin holders. In many of these instances, the customers of such exchanges have not been compensated or made whole for the partial or complete loss of their account balances. At this time, there is no U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative, or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrencies from an exchange. Consequently, an exchange may be unable to replace missing cryptocurrencies or seek reimbursement for any theft of cryptocurrencies, adversely affecting investors. </p>
        <p>Exchange difficulties</p>
        <p>Any financial, security or operational difficulties experienced by Crypto asset exchanges may result in an inability of Token Generator to recover money, cryptocurrencies being held by the exchange, or to pay investors upon a return of Tokens. Further, Token Generator may be unable to recover cryptocurrencies awaiting transmission into or out of Token Generator, all of which could adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator. Additionally, to the extent that a Crypto asset exchange represents a substantial portion of the volume in particular cryptocurrencies trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such exchanges' failures may result in loss or less favorable prices of a particular Crypto asset, or may adversely affect Token Generator, its operations and investments, or Token-holders. </p>
        <p>No warranties</p>
        <p>Due to the nature of electronic communication processes, cryptocurrencies exchanges typically do not guarantee or warrant their websites or electronic platforms will be uninterrupted, without delay, error-free, omission-free, or free of viruses. Therefore, information and services provided by Crypto asset exchanges are typically provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including accuracy, timeliness and completeness.</p>
        <p>Lack of investor protection</p>
        <p>When trading cryptocurrencies , investors are generally not protected by any exchange rights. When investing in and holding cryptocurrencies issued by an entity or organisation, investors generally do not possess any shareholder or similar rights with respect to that issuing entity or organisation. </p>
        <p><b>Volatility</b></p>
        <p>Rapid fluctuations in value</p>
        <p>A principal risk in trading cryptocurrencies is the rapid fluctuation of its market price of such assets. The value of Tokens may relate directly to the value of the cryptocurrencies held in Token Generator and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrencies could adversely affect the net asset value of Tokens. There is no guarantee that Token Generator will be able to achieve a better than average market price for its cryptocurrencies or will purchase such cryptocurrencies at the most favorable price available. The price of cryptocurrencies achieved by Token Generator may be affected generally by a wide variety of complex and difficult to predict factors such as supply and demand; rewards and transaction fees for the recording of transactions on the applicable blockchain; availability and access to virtual currency service providers (such as payment processors), exchanges, miners or other blockchain users and market participants; security vulnerability; inflation levels; fiscal policy; interest rates and political, natural and economic events. </p>
        <p>General supply and demand risks</p>
        <p>To the extent the public demand for cryptocurrencies were to decrease, or Token Generator was unable to find a willing buyer, the price of cryptocurrencies could fluctuate rapidly and Token Generator may be unable to sell the cryptocurrencies in its possession or custody. Token-holders in the queue for having their Tokens returned will remain subject to the risk of price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies until their Tokens are fully returned. </p>
        <p>Further, if the supply of cryptocurrencies available to the public were to increase or decrease suddenly, for example due to a sell off of newly generated cryptocurrencies by Crypto asset miners or ICO participants, a change in a blockchain network's source code, the dissolution of a virtual currency exchange, seizure of cryptocurrencies by government authorities, or other event unrelated to the foregoing, such event(s) may create downward pressure on the price of a Crypto asset causing the price of a Crypto asset to drop rapidly.</p>
        <p>Such changes in demand and supply could adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator. In addition, governments may intervene, directly and by regulation, in the Crypto asset market, with the specific effect, or intention, of influencing Crypto asset prices and valuation (e.g., releasing previously seized cryptocurrencies). </p>
        <p>Retail and commercial usages</p>
        <p>Currently, there is relatively modest use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the retail and commercial marketplace compared to its use by speculators, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect the Tokens and Token Generator. If future regulatory actions or policies limit the ability to own or exchange Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the retail and commercial marketplace, or use them for payments, or own them generally, the price and demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may decrease. Such decrease in demand may result in the termination and liquidation of Token Generator at a time that may be disadvantageous to Token-holders, or may adversely affect Token Generator's net asset value.</p>
        <p>Investment market</p>
        <p>Private and professional investors and speculators invest and trade in cryptocurrencies. These market participants may range from exchange-traded-funds, private investment funds, brokers and day-traders. Certain activity involving such cryptocurrencies may require approvals, licenses or registration, which may serve as a barrier to entry of investors, thereby limiting the market for cryptocurrencies. There is no assurance that the investment market for cryptocurrencies will continue to grow.</p>
        <p>Risks relating to development and acceptance of blockchain networks</p>
        <p>The growth and use of cryptocurrencies generally, and the Bitcoin network specifically, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Indeed, the future of the industry likely depends on several factors, including, but not limited to: (a) economic and regulatory conditions relating to both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies; (b) government regulation of the use of and access to cryptocurrencies; (c) government regulation of Crypto asset service providers, administrators or exchanges; (d) the domestic and global market demand for—and availability of—other forms of virtual currency or payment methods; and, (e) uniquely regarding Bitcoin, the security, integrity and adoption of the Bitcoin network source code protocol. Any slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of Bitcoin or the Bitcoin network may adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator.</p>
        <p><b>Transactional risks</b></p>
        <p>Credit risks</p>
        <p>Token Generator may transact with private buyers or sellers or exchanges. Token Generator will take on credit risk every time it purchases or sells a cryptocurrencies, and its contractual rights with respect to such transactions may be limited. Although Token Generator's transfers of cryptocurrencies or cash will be made to or from a counterparty which the Token Generator believes is trustworthy, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, Token Generator's cryptocurrencies or cash could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that Token Generator is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party which has received Token Generator's cryptocurrencies or cash (through error or theft), Token Generator will be unable to recover incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies or cash, and such losses will negatively impact Token Generator and the Tokens.</p>
        <p>Irreversible nature of blockchain transactions</p>
        <p>Transactions involving cryptocurrencies that have been verified, and thus recorded as a block on the blockchain, generally cannot be undone. Even if the transaction turns out to have been in error, or due to theft of a user's Crypto asset, the transaction is not reversible. Further, at this time, there is no governmental, regulatory, investigative, or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrencies. Consequently, Token Generator may be unable to replace missing cryptocurrencies or seek reimbursement for any erroneous transfer or theft of cryptocurrencies. To the extent that Token Generator is unable to seek redress for such action, error or theft, such loss could adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator. </p>
        <p>Exchange limits</p>
        <p>Certain Crypto asset exchanges may place limits on Token Generator's transactions, or Token Generator may be unable to find a willing buyer or seller of a Crypto asset. To the extent Token Generator experiences difficulty in buying or selling Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies or tokens, investors may experience delays in subscriptions or payment of proceeds of Token returns, or there may be delays in liquidation of Token Generator's cryptocurrencies—adversely affecting the net asset value of Token Generator.</p>
        <p>Government intervention</p>
        <p>There exists the possibility that while acquiring or disposing of cryptocurrencies, Token Generator unknowingly engages in transactions with bad actors who are under the scrutiny of government investigative agencies. As such, Token Generator's systems or a portion thereof may be taken off-line pursuant to legal process such as the service of a search and/or seizure warrant. Such action could result in the loss of cryptocurrencies previously under Token Generator's control.</p>
        <p><b>Theft or loss of digital assets</b></p>
        <p>Loss of private keys</p>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are intended to be controllable only by the possessor of the unique private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which the cryptocurrencies are held. To the extent private keys relating to Token Generator's cryptocurrencies are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, Token Generator will be unable to access the related cryptocurrencies. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store Token Generator's cryptocurrencies could adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator. </p>
        <p>Third party wallet providers</p>
        <p>Token Generator intends to use third party wallet providers to hold Token Generator's cryptocurrencies. Token Generator may have a high concentration of its cryptocurrencies in one location or with one third party wallet provider, which may be prone to losses arising out of hacking, loss of passwords, compromised access credentials, malware, or cyber-attacks. Token Generator is not required to maintain a minimum number of wallet providers to hold Token Generator's cryptocurrencies. Token Generator may not do detailed information technology diligence on such third party wallet providers and, as a result, may not be aware of all security vulnerabilities and risks. Certain third party wallet providers may not indemnify Token Generator against any losses of cryptocurrencies. cryptocurrencies held by third parties could be transferred into "cold storage" or "deep storage," in which case there could be a delay in retrieving such cryptocurrencies. Token Generator may also incur costs related to third party storage. Any security breach, incurred cost or loss of cryptocurrencies associated with the use of a third party wallet provider, may adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator.</p>
        <p><b>Theft of private keys and malicious attacks</b></p>
        <p>Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise, or secure cryptocurrencies, such as by attacking the applicable blockchain network source code, exchange servers, third-party platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, or cryptocurrencies transaction history, or by other means. For example, in February 2014, Mt. Gox suspended withdrawals because it discovered hackers were able to obtain control over the exchange's Bitcoin. Further, Flexcoin, a so-called Bitcoin bank, was hacked in March 2014 when attackers exploited a flaw in the code governing transfers between users by flooding the system with requests before the account balances could update—resulting in the theft of 896 Bitcoin. As Token Generator increases in size, it may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. At this time, there is no governmental, regulatory, investigative, or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrencies. Consequently, Token Generator may be unable to replace missing cryptocurrencies or seek reimbursement for any theft, adversely affecting an investment.</p>
        <p>Risk of uninsured losses</p>
        <p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, cryptocurrencies are uninsured. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurer to offer recourse.</p>
        <p>Money laundering</p>
        <p>Transactions in cryptocurrencies may be misused for criminal activities, including money laundering. Transactions in cryptocurrencies are public, but the owners and recipients of these transactions generally are not. Transactions are largely untraceable, and provide Crypto asset consumers with a high degree of anonymity. It is therefore possible that the Crypto asset network will be used for transactions associated with criminal activities, including money laundering. This misuse could affect investors, as law enforcement agencies may decide to close exchange platforms and prevent investors from accessing or using any funds that the platforms may be holding for them. Transacting with a counterparty making illicit use of Bitcoin could have a material adverse effect on Token Generator. </p>
        <p>Tax and accounting standards</p>
        <p>The tax characterization of cryptocurrencies is evolving in many jurisdictions and the investing and trading in cryptocurrencies by Token Generator may have tax implications, such as value added tax or capital gains tax, of which Token Generator may not appropriately predict in advance and/or account for. In addition, the net asset value of Token Generator at the time any subscriptions, returns or exchanges of Tokens occur may reflect a direct or indirect accrual for tax liabilities, including estimates of such tax liabilities, that may not ultimately be paid. Accounting standards may also change, creating an obligation for Token Generator to accrue for a tax liability that was not previously required to be accrued for or in situations where it is not expected that Token Generator will directly or indirectly be ultimately subject to such tax liability. Additionally, application of tax laws and regulations may result in increased, ongoing costs, or accounting related expenses, adversely affecting the value of Tokens. </p>
        <p>Regulation under US Commodity Exchange Act</p>
        <p>Registration with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a “commodity pool operator” or as a “commodity trading advisor” or any change in the Token Generator's operations necessary to maintain the Token Generator's ability to rely upon the exemptions from registration as such could adversely affect the Token Generator and Token Generator's ability to implement its investment program, conduct its operations and/or achieve its objectives and subject Token Generator to certain additional costs, expenses and administrative burdens. Furthermore, any determination by the Token Generator to cease or to limit investing in interests which may be treated as “commodity interests” in order to comply with the regulations of the CFTC may have a material adverse effect on Token Generator's ability to implement its investment objectives and to hedge risks associated with its operations. </p>
        <p>Risks associated with initial coin offerings</p>
        <p>Token Generator may invest in initial coin offerings (ICOs). Token Generator' investments in these assets may be very sensitive to movements in related markets and trends and ICO markets, including regulatory developments, enforcement actions, security concerns and technological developments. In addition, by investing in such assets Token Generator may be subject to international, federal and state securities, commodity or other laws which may, among other things, restrict Token Generator's ability to sell a portfolio investment and adversely impact the value of its assets. Many ICO issuers do not have lengthy operating histories and the success of a particular Crypto asset issued under and ICO may be dependent on the management of such issuer. </p>
        <p><b>Network integrity and security risks for digital assets generally</b></p>
        <p>Forking</p>
        <p>Certain cryptocurrencies are susceptible to risks of a fork occurring on the distributed ledger of transactions of such Crypto asset. If miners of the underlying blockchain of such Crypto asset solve a block at approximately the same time, it causes a "fork" in the blockchain. Certain network protocols utilizing a proof of work mining model try to resolve forks by automatically giving priority to the longest blockchain in the fork. If forks are unresolved there are effectively two networks operating at the same time, each with its own version of the transaction history. This creates an increased risk of receiving a double-spend transaction, and a general systemic risk to the integrity and security of the applicable Crypto asset network. To the extent that a significant majority of users and miners on the applicable network install software that changes the network or properties of a particular Crypto asset, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new Cryptocurrencies or Tokens, such network would be subject to new protocols and software that may result in a "fork" of the network, adversely affecting the value of Tokens. Similarly, if less than a significant majority of users and miners on the network install such software, the network could "fork," which may adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator. To the extent that any temporary or permanent forks exist in the blockchain, the value of Tokens may be adversely affected.</p>
        <p>Mining risks</p>
        <p>Certain cryptocurrencies are susceptible to risks associated with how the underlying blockchain of such Crypto asset are mined. If rewards and transaction fees are not properly matched to the efforts of miners, miners may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining. Miners ceasing operations could not only adversely impact the price of the cryptocurrencies but also reduce the collective processing power on the blockchain network, adversely affect the validation process for transactions, and, generally, make the network more vulnerable. Further, if a single miner or a mining pool gains a majority share in a given blockchain network's computing power, the integrity of the blockchain may be affected. A miner or mining pool could reverse transactions of such Crypto asset, make double-spend transactions, prevent confirmations or prevent other miners from mining valid blocks. Each of these scenarios could reduce confidence in the validation process or processing power of the network, and adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator.</p>
        <p>Amendments to protocol</p>
        <p>The development team and administrators of a network's source code for any given Crypto asset could propose amendments to such network's protocols and software that, if accepted and authorized, or not accepted, by the network community, could adversely affect the supply, security, value, or market share of that Crypto asset and thus the value of Tokens.</p>
        <p>Malware</p>
        <p>Malware is software used or programmed by malicious actors to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information or gain access to private computer systems. "Botnet" refers generally to a group of computers that use malware to compromise computers whose security defenses have been breached. To the extent that a malicious actor, cyber-criminal, computer virus, hacker, or botnet (e.g., ZeroAccess) obtains a majority of the processing power on a network for any given Crypto asset; or alters the source code and blockchain on which all cryptocurrencies transactions rely, the value of Tokens could be adversely affected.</p>
        <p>Weaknesses or exploitable breakthroughs in cryptography</p>
        <p>Cryptography is an art, not a science, and the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and underlying blockchain networks supporting such cryptocurrencies.</p>
        <p><b>Network integrity and security risks for BTC</b></p>
        <p>Bad actors</p>
        <p>The source code used to form the Bitcoin is attributed to "Satoshi Nakamoto" a pseudonym to a presently unidentified individual or group of individuals who may be acting alone or in concert with a government, government organization or group with malevolent tendencies. As such, only the portions of the source code that have been made public have been analyzed with regards to operation, ability to generate Bitcoin, and to conduct transactions in the previously described manner. There may exist an unseen portion of the original code wherein a pre-existing sub-routine and/or virus has been placed which will activate at a future time (determined by the original code writer(s)) causing disruptions to the blockchain and/or resulting in substantial losses, theft of Bitcoin, unauthorized transactions and the issuance of duplicate Bitcoin. Further, since the identity of the original code writer(s) is not known, one cannot discount the possibility of the same unknown individual(s) inserting and/or activating a sub-routine or artifact allowing said person(s) to manipulate a portion of the Bitcoin programming and/or block chain itself to the benefit of this individual(s) (i.e., by programming a portion of each Bitcoin to transfer to such individual's Bitcoin wallet).</p>
        <p>Bitcoin mining risks</p>
        <p>As the number of Bitcoin awarded for solving a block in the blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to contribute processing power to the Bitcoin network will transition from a set reward to transaction fees. Either the requirement from miners of higher transaction fees in exchange for recording transactions in the blockchain or a software upgrade that automatically charges fees for all transactions may decrease demand for Bitcoin and prevent the expansion of the Bitcoin network to retail merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in value. To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, transactions that do not include the payment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees. Any such delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in the Bitcoin network, which could adversely impact the value of Tokens.</p>
        <p>Investments in private enterprises</p>
        <p>Many investment opportunities in blockchain technologies that Token Generator may invest in are start-up companies with limited operating history and/or small private enterprises with small market capitalization. While Token Generator believes that such investments can provide potential for appreciation, it recognizes that such investments involve higher risks than investments in larger or more established companies and the value of such investments is likely to be more volatile. Further, the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency of such companies (with the attendant loss to investors) is higher than for larger and more established companies. In addition, investments in these types of companies may be characterized by reduced liquidity and more abrupt and erratic market price movements than those of larger, more established companies.</p>
        <p>Digital asset service providers; conflicts</p>
        <p>Token Generator may be subject to conflicts relating to its selection of Crypto asset intermediaries, exchanges and counterparties on behalf of Token Generator. Portfolio transactions for Token Generator will be allocated to intermediaries, exchanges and counterparties on the basis of numerous factors and not necessarily lowest pricing. Intermediaries, exchanges and counterparties may provide other services that are beneficial to the Token Generator but not necessarily beneficial to the Token holder. The Administrator and other service providers may also provide services to other vehicles with similar investment programs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest. In addition, subject to applicable law, any of the service providers may deal, as principal or agent, with Token Generator; provided, that such dealings are on normal commercial terms negotiated on an arm's-length basis. Token Generator's service providers and their principals, employees or affiliates may trade in cryptocurrencies outside of Token Generator, which may conflict or compete with Token Generator, including by buying or selling cryptocurrencies when Token Generator is doing the opposite. </p>
        <p>Trade errors</p>
        <p>Token Generator may on occasion experience errors with respect to trades made on its behalf. Trade errors may include, for example, (i) the placement of orders (either purchases or sales) in excess of the amount of cryptocurrencies Token Generator intended to trade; (ii) the sale of cryptocurrencies when it should have been purchased; (iii) the purchase of cryptocurrencies when it should have been sold; (iv) the purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies contrary to regulatory restrictions or Token Generator investment guidelines or restrictions; (v) incorrect allocations of trades; and (vi) keystroke errors that occur when entering trades into an electronic trading system. Trade errors may result in losses or gains. The Token Generator generally will endeavour to detect trade errors prior to settlement and correct and/or mitigate them in an expeditious manner. However, this may not be practicable with respect to cryptocurrencies. To the extent an error is caused by a counterparty, the Token Generator will seek to recover any losses associated with such error from the counterparty.</p>
        <p>Risks associated with intellectual property rights</p>
        <p>Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of Certain cryptocurrencies and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in Crypto asset network’s long-term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and transfer Crypto asset may adversely affect the Tokens (including its intended function) and the Token Generator.</p>
        <p><b>Risks due to the company's structure</b></p>
        <p>Lack of operating history</p>
        <p>Token Generator is a newly formed entity. As such, it does not have a prior operating history that a prospective investor can evaluate before making an investment. Consequently, a prospective investor should evaluate Token Generator's investment program on the basis that no one can guarantee that the Token Generator' assessment of the short- or long-term prospects of its investment strategies will prove accurate, or that Token Generator will achieve its investment objective.</p>
        <p>Dependence on key personnel</p>
        <p>Token Generator's investment activities depend on the experience and expertise of the principals of the Token Generator. If a principal leaves the Token Generator, this may have a material adverse effect on Token Generator's operations.</p>
        <p>Absence of regulatory oversight</p>
        <p>Token Generator is not currently a regulated mutual fund under the Mutual Funds Law and it is not required to, nor does it intend to, register under the laws of any jurisdiction. As a consequence, the statutes of certain jurisdictions (which may provide certain regulatory safeguards to investors) do not apply. For example, Token Generator is not required to maintain custody of its cryptocurrencies or securities or place its cryptocurrencies or securities in the custody of a bank or member of a recognised securities exchange in the same way as required under the statutes of some other jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>Generally, a registered investment company that places its securities in the custody of a member of a recognised securities exchange is required to have a written custodian agreement. Typically, such an agreement provides that securities held in custody must be kept separate from the securities of any other person and that those securities must be clearly identified as the property of the investment company. It also contains other provisions requiring compliance with applicable regulations. However, Token Generator may maintain accounts at a brokerage firm that does not keep assets separate in that way as would be the case for a registered investment company. In those circumstances, if the brokerage firm becomes insolvent, the insolvency may affect Token Generator more adversely than a registered investment company's insolvency would affect Token Generator.</p>
        <p>Limited rights of Token-holders</p>
        <p>A purchase of Tokens should be regarded as an investment decision that is fundamentally different than investing in a company, partnership or investment fund. This is because Token-holders have no right to participate in the day-to-day operations of Token Generator, receive notice of, attend or vote at shareholder meetings of Token Generator or otherwise exercise rights applicable to directors/shareholders/partners/unitholders. Consequently, Token-holders have no control over the management of Token Generator or over the appointment and removal of its directors and service providers. </p>
        <p>Side letters</p>
        <p>From time to time, Token Generator or the Token Generator, or both may enter into agreements (Side Letters) with certain prospective or existing Token-holders, under which those members receive advantages not appearing in this White Paper. For example, a Side Letter with a prospective or existing Token-holder may give that Token-holder one or more of the following advantages over other holders of Tokens generally:</p>
        <ul className="small"><li>special rights to make future investments in Token Generator, other investment vehicles or managed accounts; </li></ul>
        <li>special Token return rights relating to frequency, period of notice, Token return fees (whether in the form of a reduction or rebate), Token return penalties payable or other terms, or any combination of these;</li>
        <li>rights to receive reports from Token Generator on a more frequent basis or that include information not provided to other Token-holders (including, without limitation, more detailed information regarding portfolio positions); </li>
        <li>the waiver, reduction or rebate of fees payable in respect of such Token-holder's Tokens; and</li>
        <li>such other rights as may be negotiated by Token Generator and that Token-holder.</li>
        <p>The terms of any Side Letters are in the sole discretion of Token Generator. They may be based on the following things, amongst others: (i) the size of the Token-holder's investment; (ii) an undertaking by the Token-holder to maintain its investment for a significant period of time; or (iii) some other similar undertaking by the Token-holder to Token Generator.</p>
        <p>Other liabilities</p>
        <p>Due to existing corporate structures liabilities resulting from C20 and the operation of the related tokenized fund and issuance thereof may be liabilities of the Token Generator.
        </p>
        <p><b>Valuation of Token Generator's investments</b></p>
        <p>Valuation of Token Generator's cryptocurrencies or securities and other investments may involve uncertainties and judgmental determinations. If a valuation is incorrect, the Net Asset Value may be adversely affected. Independent pricing information about some of Token Generator's cryptocurrencies or securities and other investments may not always be available. However, valuations will be made in good faith.</p>
        <p>If the value assigned by Token Generator to an investment differs from its actual value, the Net Asset Value may be either understated or overstated to the extent of that difference. Consequently, if the actual value of some of Token Generator's investments is higher than the value assigned to them, a Token-holder holding Tokens who returns all or part of its Tokens while they are so undervalued may be paid less than if they were correctly valued. Conversely, if the actual value of some of Token Generator's investments is lower than the value assigned to them, the Token-holder may, in effect, be overpaid.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a purchase of Tokens by a new member (or an additional investment by an existing Token-holder) may dilute the value of Token Generator's investments for the other Token-holders if those investments are undervalued. Conversely, a new Token-holder (or an existing Token-holder who makes an additional investment) could pay too much if Token Generator's investments are overvalued by Token Generator. If either of these scenarios happens, Token Generator does not intend to adjust the Net Asset Value retroactively.</p>
        <p>Neither the Token Generator, nor Token Generator or Administrator will be liable if a price or valuation used in good faith in connection with any of the above procedures, later proves to be incorrect or inaccurate.</p>
        <p>In-kind distributions</p>
        <p>A Token-holder returning their Tokens may, in the discretion of the Token Generator, receive cryptocurrencies or securities owned by Token Generator in lieu of or in combination with BTC. The value of cryptocurrencies or securities distributed may increase or decrease before the cryptocurrencies or securities can be sold, and the investor will incur transaction costs in connection with the sale of those cryptocurrencies or securities. Additionally, cryptocurrencies or securities distributed to a Token-holder in connection with a reversion may not be readily marketable. In those circumstances, the investor bears the risk of loss and delay in liquidating those cryptocurrencies or securities, with the result that it may ultimately receive less BTC than it would otherwise have received if it had been paid in BTC alone for its Tokens on the date of reversion. Token Generator may be unable to make distributions in kind, including distributions of cryptocurrencies, for a number of reasons including concerns from the Token Generator or Administrator that doing so would be in breach of applicable anti-money laundering laws or policies and procedures. In addition Token Generator may be unable to liquidate cryptocurrencies or hold the cash proceeds of liquidation in traditional bank accounts. In certain instances Token Generator may only be able to satisfy Token return requests by making distributions of cash. If Token Generator is unable to satisfy Token return requests by payments in kind, it may not have enough cash or access to traditional bank accounts to satisfy all reversion requests and Token-holders may be unable to liquidate their investments or Token Generator may face solvency issues.</p>
        <p><b>Other investment and trading risks</b></p>
        <p>Overall investment risk</p>
        <p>All investments in cryptocurrencies or securities risk the loss of capital. There may be increased risk due to the nature of the cryptocurrencies or securities to be purchased and traded by Token Generator and the investment techniques and strategies used to try to increase profits. While the Token Generator will devote its best efforts to the management of Token Generator's portfolio, it cannot give an assurance that Token Generator will not incur losses. Many unforeseeable events, including actions by various government agencies and domestic and international political events, may cause sharp market fluctuations.</p>
        <p>Risks of global investing</p>
        <p>Token Generator invests in various capital markets throughout the world. As a result, Token Generator is subject to risks relating to the following:</p>
        <li>currency exchange matters, including fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the base currency of Token Generator and various other currencies in which its investments may be denominated, and costs associated with converting investment principal and income from one currency into another; and</li>
        <li>the possible imposition of withholding taxes on income received from the issuer of, or gains with respect to, those investments.</li>
        <p>In addition, investing in some of these capital markets involves factors not typically associated with investing in established securities markets. These include risks relating to the following:</p>
        <li>differences between markets, including potential price volatility in and relative illiquidity of some securities markets;</li>
        <li>the absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and disclosure requirements, and less governmental supervision and regulation; and</li>
        <li>certain economic and political risks, including potential exchange control regulations or restrictions on investment and repatriation of capital.</li>
        <p>Currency risks</p>
        <p>Token Generator's assets will be invested in cryptocurrencies denominated in various currencies and in other financial instruments, the price of which will be determined with reference to those currencies. To the extent they are not hedged, the value of Token Generator's net assets will fluctuate with exchange rates as well as with price changes of its investments in the various local markets and currencies. </p>
        <p>Counterparty and settlement risk</p>
        <p>Due to the nature of some of the investments that Token Generator may make, Token Generator may rely on the ability of the counterparty to a transaction to perform its obligations. If that party fails to complete its obligations for any reason, Token Generator may suffer losses and therefore be exposed to a credit risk on the counterparties with which it trades. Token Generator will also bear the risk of settlement default by clearing houses and exchanges. A default by a counterparty or a default on settlement could have a material adverse effect on Token Generator.</p>
        <p>Borrowing</p>
        <p>Token Generator is permitted to finance its operations with secured and unsecured borrowing to the maximum extent allowable under applicable credit regulations. Token Generator may suffer losses if there are adverse changes in the level of market prices of the assets being financed with the borrowings.</p>
        <p>Risk of litigation</p>
        <p>In the ordinary course of business, Token Generator may be subject to litigation from time to time. In addition, Token Generator may accumulate substantial positions in the securities or cryptocurrencies of issuers or counterparties that become involved in proxy contests or other litigation, including regulatory investigations or prosecutions. As a result of such investments, Token Generator could be named as a defendant in a lawsuit or regulatory action. The outcome of such proceedings, which may materially adversely affect the value of Token Generator, may be impossible to anticipate, and such proceedings may continue without resolution for long periods of time. Any litigation may consume substantial amounts of the Token Generator's time and attention, and that time and the devotion of these resources to litigation may, at times, be disproportionate to the amounts at stake in the litigation. No legal or arbitration proceedings are pending or, to the best of Token Generator' knowledge, threatened against Token Generator since Token Generator' formation.</p>
